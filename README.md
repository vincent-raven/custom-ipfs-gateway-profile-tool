# custom-ipfs-gateway-profile-tool
A concept to empower users to control their own content by setting up custom IPFS gateways in platform profiles
# Control Your Own Content – Custom IPFS Gateway Profile Integration

## Concept Summary
Empower users to manage and access their content through their own IPFS gateway—set once in their profile—while the platform provides upload and view interfaces. Content not meant for the platform can be managed independently via form-based tools. The marketplace already exists for users to list and promote their tools.

## User Journey & Feature Steps

### 1. Gateway Setup in Profile
- User goes to their profile settings.
- Platform provides a form:
  - **Field:** "Your IPFS Gateway URL" (e.g., `https://my-gateway.com:5001`)
  - **Save**: Once submitted, this URL is saved to the user’s profile in the database.

### 2. Traffic Routing
- All uploads and click-to-view content actions for that user are routed through their chosen gateway.
- Platform’s upload/view UI remains unchanged for the user, except content is handled via their custom gateway.
- If no gateway set: Platform can use a default gateway or disable content actions until set.

### 3. Pinning Responsibility
- Platform does **NOT** handle pinning.
  - Users are informed that content persistence is their responsibility (they must pin via their chosen method or risk content disappearing).
- Optionally, provide info or links in the UI about how to pin content using their gateway or third-party services.

### 4. Marketplace Integration
- Builders create and list their tools as usual using existing platform-provided forms.
- Tools may leverage the profile gateway setting for any user-managed, off-platform content workflows.

### 5. Optional: Advanced Settings
- Allow users to update or remove their gateway at any time.
- Optionally, provide a "Test Gateway" button for users to check connectivity.

### 6. Security/Privacy
- Gateway URL is stored per-user and only used to process that user’s content actions.
- Platform does not access, store, or proxy content except as routed through the user’s chosen gateway.

## Builder Guidelines
- Use the platform-provided forms for creating marketplace listings.
- Respect the user’s gateway setting for all content uploads and retrievals.
- Do not offer or imply platform-level pinning.
- Clearly communicate to users that content persistence is their responsibility.
- Any additional tools (e.g., for off-platform pinning or local node management) can be listed in the marketplace and can access the user’s gateway setting as needed.

## Sample Profile Setting Form
```html
<form>
  <label for="gateway_url">Your IPFS Gateway URL:</label>
  <input type="url" id="gateway_url" name="gateway_url" required placeholder="https://my-gateway.com:5001">
  <button type="submit">Save Gateway</button>
</form>
<p>
  <em>Note: All your uploads and content views will use this gateway.<br>
  You are responsible for pinning your content for persistence.</em>
</p>
```

## Summary Statement for Marketplace/Builders
> This feature lets users take full ownership of their content by routing uploads and views through their own IPFS gateway, set once in their profile. Pinning and long-term storage are the user's responsibility, maximizing privacy and control and minimizing platform involvement. Marketplace tools can use these settings for additional custom workflows.
